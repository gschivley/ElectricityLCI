This document is a record of changes to the EPA branch of electricitylci and
other repositories.

- ELCI_<>_config.json files:
    - Added boolean parameter "replace_egrid", which will trigger the use of EIA/CEMS
    data in place of eGRID generation and emissions data.
    - Added parameter "eia_gen_year" to set the year of EIA electricity generation
    data.
    - Added parameter "region_column_name" that is used to specify the name of a
    column with region identifiers. Needed for things like FERC market regions.
    NOTE: This parameter overrides function parameters for regions such as "all",
    "BA", "NERC", etc.
- eia923_generation.py
    - Rewrote the download and extraction. One function now downloads excel files
    for a single year, another extracts generation data. These are used to extract
    and save data to csv. CSV data are then loaded when they exist.
    - Files for each year are saved in a subfolder of "data" rather than at the
    top level.
    - Primary fuel can be determined here using either generation or fuel
    consumption methods.
    - Filters for efficiency, percent generation from primary fuel, and NAICS code
    are now included in this module.
    - Multiple years of generation data can be loaded in a single dataframe
    for matching with emissions data from a range of years.
- eia860_facilities.py
    - Created a new module to download/save EIA860 plant data.
    - Determine the balancing authority and NERC region for each plant (when
    not using eGRID).
- generation.py
    - Created a new function (eia_facility_fuel_region) to provide the balancing
    authority, NERC region, primary fuel category, and percent of generation
    from the primary fuel category. This is needed when not using eGRID.
    - Modified the "create_generation_process_df" function so that it can use
    non-eGRID data inputs. This is accomplished with a few if/else statements
    using the "replace_egrid" parameter.
    - Pulled the creation and/or dropping of some columns out of the loops in
    "create_generation_df" to reduce runtime. Some of the columns were created
    in other functions (e.g. add_technological_correlation_score, etc.).
    - Removed column creation and dropping columns from the data quality and
    representativeness functions to reduce runtime.
- generation_mix.py
    - Modify to allow replacement of eGRID generation data.
    - Simplify the logic in "create_generation_mix_process_df_from_model_generation_data"
    by using groupby methods rather than for loops.
- process_exchange_aggregator_uncertainty.py
    - Replace the sympy solve of quadratic equation with explicit formulas in
    the "uncertainty" function. This reduces runtime of process df creation by
    about half. It's possible that it may introduce a bug with imaginary number
    results.
    - Looked at the "weight" parameter in "compilation" function. The parameter is
    always equal to 1 right now, so I'm not sure if this is expected. A bug report
    has been filed on jira.
- Created the module "emissions_other_sources". The one function in this file,
    "integrate_replace_emissions" will be used to update facility emissions with
    new values calcualted using CEMS and manual calculations.
- __init__.py
    - The functions "get_generation_process_df" and "get_generation_mix_process_df"
    have been modified so eGRID can be replaced as the primary source of generation
    data.
